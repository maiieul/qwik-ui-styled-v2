# Callout design decisions

## Name

## Composition

As a base component, the Callout is composed of 3 parts: Root, Title, and Description.

<!-- To review -->

It does not include an Image component, because the positioning and anchoring of images depends a lot on the context and purpose of the Card. It is better to let the designer chose how to display the image.
